# Module 10: Structural Data Analysis - Inferences

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive structural characterization of the solvation shell, integrating RDFs, coordination numbers, and angular distributions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Radial Distribution Functions (RDF)
- **C60-Water (g_CO)**:
    - **ε < 0.25**: Broad, low first peak shifted to larger distances (dewetting/gap).
    - **ε > 0.50**: Sharp, high first peak at contact distance (~3.5-4.0 Å).
    - **Transition**: Gradual sharpening and inward shift of the first peak.

### 2. Coordination Numbers
- **First Shell**:
    - Increases significantly with epsilon.
    - Hydrophobic: ~20-30 waters (loose shell).
    - Hydrophilic: ~60+ waters (dense shell).
- **Implication**: The "effective" size of the nanoparticle increases with hydrophilicity due to the tightly bound water layer.

### 3. Angular Orientation
- **Dipole Orientation**:
    - Hydrophobic: Waters orient tangentially to maximize H-bonds with other waters.
    - Hydrophilic: Waters orient with dipoles pointing towards/away from C60 to maximize electrostatic/LJ interaction (though LJ is isotropic, packing constraints dominate).

## Methodology
- **RDF**: Histogram of pair distances normalized by ideal gas density.
- **Coordination Number**: Integral of RDF up to the first minimum.
- **Orientation**: Distribution of the angle between water dipole and surface normal.
