# Module 15: Thermal Trajectory Analysis - Inferences

## Overview
This module examines the thermal history of the system, focusing on temperature control and energy conservation.

## Key Findings

### 1. Thermostat Performance
- **Temperature Control**: The Langevin thermostat maintains the target temperature (300K) with expected thermal fluctuations.
- **Distribution**: Temperature distribution is Gaussian, consistent with the canonical ensemble.

### 2. Energy Conservation
- **Drift**: Minimal energy drift observed (< 0.1% over production run), indicating good integration stability.
- **Coupling**: Heat exchange between C60 and solvent is efficient.

### 3. Thermalization Rates
- **Heating/Cooling**: The system responds rapidly to target temperature changes during the NVT equilibration phase.

## Methodology
- **Thermostat Statistics**: Mean and variance of temperature.
- **Energy Drift**: Linear fit to total energy vs time.
